# ICE BREAKER

ICE BREAKER is a fun web app which comes handy when you have to start a conversation with someone and you need a topic to break the ice. 

# REQUIREMENTS:
ICE BREAKER was built during a Hyper Island team brief where the main task was to fetch data from different public APIS and to display that in a presentable manner.
It also required the usage of "postman" for validation of API data. Network tab in google chrome to check the API call and response. 

# TECH STACK
ICE BREAKER was built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.

# LIBERARIES/FRAMEWORKS
Few other liberaries were also used while building the app for animations and loading. Further Bootstap was also used to design few parts of the application.

# LEARNINGS
Biggest learning was the knowledge of communication of data through APIs.
During this brief, we started with mobile first approach. We learned and paracticed creating responsive web apps. It also gave us an opportunity to paractice media queries to control the display on different break points.
